That's an app which fetch external data using Redux and render HTML without using WebViewers.

### Pre-requisites
You'll need to configure your environment to use React Native to run the apps. [Check out the documentation for each OS and then jump to the next step](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html). Select the "Building Projects with Native Code" tab option to follow the instructions.

### Installation
After cloning the project and configuring the environment, run the command `npm install` to install the dependencies and then just run `react-native run-android` to run in the Android Simulator/Device (Make sure you have a device connected or a simulator already running) or `react-native run-ios` to run the iOS Simulator (Needs an iOS system to do this).
